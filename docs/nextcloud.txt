# Ldap support

Install the ldap app from the app store in nextcloud.

Start the lldap stack.

Follow this guide to setup https://github.com/lldap/lldap/blob/main/example_configs/nextcloud.md.

The agent name should be uid=admin,ou=people,dc=ascyii,dc=de.

The hostname is just lldap because nextcloud and lldap containers are in the same network.
